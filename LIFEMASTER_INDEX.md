# LifeMaster – Document Index & Authority Order

This project contains multiple documents.  
They must be interpreted in the following strict order of authority:

1. SYSTEM_RULES.md  
   Defines how the system reasons, prioritizes, and limits itself.
   This file overrides all others in case of conflict.

2. TRUTH_STATE.md  
   Contains factual, medical, historical, and constraint-related information about the user.
   Considered authoritative unless explicitly updated.

3. WORKING_MODE.md  
   Defines communication style, depth, pacing, and collaboration preferences.
   Applies only when not conflicting with higher-level rules.

4. DYNAMIC_STATE.md  
   Represents the current operational status.
   This file is temporal and may change frequently.

If ambiguity exists:
- Prefer safety over optimization
- Prefer consistency over novelty
- Prefer adherence over intensity
